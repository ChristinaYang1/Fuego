<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->
<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am Christina Yang</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3> Hello! I'm Christina Yang. I go to the University of Pittsburgh. Currently, I am taking JPNSE 0085 (Japanese Tales of Supernatural), ENGCMP 1130 (Projects in Digital Composition), INFSCI 0410 (Human-Centered Systems), CS0445 (Algorithms & Data Structure 1), and ENGCMP 0610 (Composing digital media). The major I am currently pursuing is Digital Narrative and Interactive Design (DNID). Orginally, I was in the Health Informatics due to the job market being desirable (and it pays quite nicely). However, I ended up switching to DNID since it's being more aligned with my interest and the electives are much more fun. I am also almost done with my economics minor. Unrelated to University of Pittsburgh, I have been completing the online Google Certificates on Coursera for UX design. Personally not sure if it's useful, however, I believe the knowledge won't go to waste.  </h3>

<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->

<!--What experience do you have to leverage in this class? Are you a writer, are you a maker, are you a thinker or critic? What is your medium/media? What interests you about that medium/those media? What media/skills do you wish to learn more about/pursue in this class?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>If I put myself in a category, I would be under the maker section. I have decent amount of experiences with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. As a visual artist, those softwares help me produce artworks in a more professional setting. For character designs and regular illustrations, I prefer using Clip Studio Paint; A popular Japanese painting software that are lean towards creating animations, comics, and raster artworks. I also have some experience with video editing using a software named Davinci Resolve, however, it is very minimal. Additionally, I have been designing on Figma, such as web design, app design, and anything related to UX/UI. During my time at Pitt, I learned how to code using Java, HTML and CSS; Admittedly, I am not great at them. For this class, I want to learn more about using After Effect and Adobe Premiere Pro. Especially for After Effect, there is quite a huge learning curve for beginners and is a bit confusing for me. Hence, I am excited to try them out.</h3>

<!--So, what exactly are you into? Take some time to explain your interest...what you will pursue in this class. What is it, define it, why is it important/significant, how do you intend to approach this subject matter?-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
    <h2>Potential Project</h2>
      <h3> As mentioned earlier, my passion lies within the art, primarily digital art. I enjoy creating new character designs, including new outfits, learning new techniques, and creating lores behind them. My art style is a mixture of anime and semi-realism. Right around when I entered college, I gained a new interest in gaming, especially RPG games such as the Omori, Persona series, and Nier: Automata. Due my desire to put my illustration skills into use and enjoyment with games, I decided to switch to DNID. Hence, when choosing topics for the projects/makings, I would most likely consider components or topics. </h3>

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path?

   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3> For career, I am aiming to do UX/UI design. I want to do something that is related to designing product that can be useful more others. It might be a bit far from my interest, but I think some aspect of my skills can be used; For example, knowing the color theory when designing is valuable for presenting a certain mood and attracting attention to areas. I already have a bit of experience on such as topic. As I have mentioned before, I have done a bit of designing during my freetime. UX/UI design is currently considered a very valuable position as well. This space can hopefully help me by exposing me to different medium and gain different knowledge. I personally believe that experiencing different softwares and learning to utilize them can make me a more valuable person in my career. Plus, I would say it's a way to enjoy my college life as well.
